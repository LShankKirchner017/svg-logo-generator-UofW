# Overview

## The Challenge:
Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in input from a user and uses those inputs to create an SVG file "Logo".

# What I learned
During this challenge I learned quite a bit. I learned more about constructors and object-oriented programming. I worked on ES6 Import/Export to modularize my files. I also worked with Jest to test my code. During this process our class discovered how to work around the issue of Jest not recognizing ES import/export which is in my package.json
